# 2D Ising model

The 2D Ising model is a classical model of spin-spin interactions on a square 2D lattice with uniform spacing.
In this repository, you'll find two implementations of this model, one in C and one in C++. Both are parallelized with OpenMP, and while the C-code provides a faster solution, the C++-code utilizes better RNGs which provides better results from the Monte Carlo simulations.
