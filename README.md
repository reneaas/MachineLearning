## Machine learning algorithms

This repository serves as my pavement to explore machine learning models. The codes are of course free to use and you may use them at your own wit.

### Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM)
I've implemented a RBM in Python, C and C++. The C-version is naturally function based, while the versions in Python and C++ are both object-oriented for an easy-to-use framework.

2. [C codes](https://github.com/reneaas/MachineLearning/tree/master/RestrictedBoltzmannMachine/C_codes)
3. [C++ codes](https://github.com/reneaas/MachineLearning/tree/master/RestrictedBoltzmannMachine/Cpp_codes)

### Clustering
Hitherto, I've implemented K-means clustering algorithm based on a simple two-layered neural network as a object-oriented C++ code.
